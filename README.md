# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

This project demonstrates the use of the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The primary goal is to group customers into distinct clusters to better understand their behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Project Overview

We use the K-means clustering algorithm to group customers based on two key features:
- `Annual Income (k$)`: The annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: A score assigned to the customer based on their spending behavior.

## Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Customer Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
- Format: `Mall_Customers.csv`

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn


## Results
The results are visualized in a scatter plot showing the clusters of customers based on their annual income and spending score. Each cluster is color-coded and cluster centers are highlighted.
